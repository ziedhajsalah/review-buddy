# Review Buddy

An AI-assisted **narrative code review** tool for Claude Code. Instead of showing a pull request as one flat diff, an agent reads the changes, writes a high-level **Prologue**, and segments the work into risk-rated thematic **Chapters** that a reviewer walks through sequentially in a browser UI.

> **Status:** Phase 1 shipped (one-way viewer): the `submit_review` MCP tool, the `PreToolUse` hook, a hardened loopback-only HTTP server, and the React viewer are all live with tests green. See `README.md` for install/dev and `docs/build-plan.md` for what's deferred to Phases 2–4.

## What it does (target flow)

```
User runs /review (skill with the structuring prompt)
        ↓
Agent reviews the diff/PR, then calls the custom tool  submit_review(<review JSON>)
        ↓
Claude Code PreToolUse hook matches  mcp__plugin_review-buddy_review-buddy__submit_review
        ↓
Hook command: capture git diff + PR metadata, start a local server, open the browser
        ↓
Prebuilt React app loads → GET /api/review → renders Prologue + Chapters + diffs
```

**Standalone (Cursor / VS Code Copilot / Codex):** same flow, but there is no `PreToolUse` — the MCP server runs with the `--standalone` flag and `submit_review` itself does the capture + serve, returning the viewer URL immediately (the viewer lives inside the long-lived MCP process). See `docs/HARNESSES.md`.

This mirrors how Plannotator (`~/code/plannotator`, the inspiration) intercepts `ExitPlanMode` — except here we intercept **our own** MCP tool, because there is no built-in "review" tool.

## The decisions that shape everything (already made — do not re-litigate)

1. **Claude Code first; other harnesses via standalone MCP mode.** Claude Code gets the richest flow (hook blocks the turn). Cursor / VS Code Copilot / Codex reuse the SAME MCP server launched with the `--standalone` flag (a flag, not an env var — ambient env would leak into the Claude Code plugin's server and double-open reviews): `submit_review` itself captures + serves and returns the viewer URL immediately — their MCP tool-call timeouts (Cursor ~5 min hard, Copilot unconfigurable) can't hold a human review; Codex can opt into `--standalone=blocking` paired with `tool_timeout_sec`. See `docs/HARNESSES.md` + `integrations/`.
2. **Transport = custom MCP tool + `PreToolUse` hook** (Claude Code). The agent calls `submit_review(...)`; a `PreToolUse` hook intercepts it (chosen over `PermissionRequest` because `PreToolUse` always fires, even in auto-accept modes). The hook **blocks** the turn (long timeout) while the human reviews.
3. **One-way viewer first**, round-trip to the agent later. Build/test rendering first; keep the blocking hook so round-trip is a drop-in later (swap the "Done" response for "approve / request-changes + annotations").
4. **JSON = runtime state, served over REST.** One prebuilt React app fetches the review from a local server (`GET /api/review`). No per-review codegen/compile. (Plannotator's model.)
5. **The agent REFERENCES the diff; it does NOT reproduce it.** This is load-bearing — see below.

## The three data sources (critical mental model)

The agent's JSON is only the **narrative layer**. The UI needs three sources:

| Source | Provides | Origin |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Agent review JSON** | prologue, chapters, risk, descriptions, chapter→file grouping, hunk **anchors** | the `submit_review` tool call |
| **B. Real diff + PR metadata** | authoritative hunk content + line numbers, original PR description, author, base/head, CI | `git diff` / `gh`, run by the hook (cwd is local) |
| **C. Full file contents** | bytes *around* the diff, for expansion + word-level highlighting | `git show` / working tree, fetched on demand |

**Reference-not-reproduce rule:** the agent must NOT echo diff line content into JSON (LLMs corrupt whitespace, drop lines, miscount line numbers, and it doubles token cost — and it fights the PRD's own #1 risk: "never fabricate changes"). Instead the agent emits, per chapter, the file paths + hunk **anchors** (`old_start` / `new_start`). The tool parses the authoritative `git diff` (source B) and maps each real hunk onto a chapter by path+anchor. Hunk-level anchors also let one file span multiple chapters. The tool recomputes all stats (additions/deletions/file counts) from the real diff — treat agent-provided stats as advisory only.

See `docs/review-contract.md` for the exact **agent contract** vs **UI/server contract**, `schemas/review.schema.json` for the `submit_review` input schema, and `src/types/review.ts` for the TypeScript types.

## Phase 1 (shipped)

Prologue + Description overview, chapter list, chapter review split-pane, and the diff viewer (unified/split, display settings, collapse "N unmodified lines", word-level granularity), with per-file controls (collapse / copy name / **expand full file** / mark viewed locally). "Expand full file" wires `/api/file-content` into the viewer via `@pierre/diffs`' full-file render path (`parseDiffFromFile` → `<FileDiff expandUnchanged>`); see `docs/DESIGN-expand-full-file.md`. Still open: "N unmodified lines" expanders *between* hunks, and rename base-side expansion (needs an endpoint allowlist change).

**Deferred to later phases** (per PRD): viewed-state persistence round-trip, verdict submission, GitHub collaboration (open PR, copy branch, reviewers, CI), Activity view, Chat, conversational AI assistant.

## Reference implementation

Plannotator at `~/code/plannotator` solves nearly the same problems. Useful files to mine:
- `apps/hook/hooks/hooks.json` — hook wiring pattern.
- `packages/server/review.ts` — review server + endpoints (`/api/diff`, `/api/file-content`, `/api/feedback`).
- `apps/review/vite.config.ts` — single-file HTML bundling (`vite-plugin-singlefile`).
- `packages/review-editor/` — diff viewer, file tree, split-pane UI.
