/**
 * Generates the per-harness review prompts under integrations/ from the single
 * template (integrations/prompt-template.md). The variants differ only in:
 *  - frontmatter (VS Code prompt files require it),
 *  - how the review target reaches the agent (trailing text vs `$ARGUMENTS`),
 *  - the blocking-verdict section (Codex is the only harness that can run
 *    `--standalone=blocking`).
 *
 * Run `bun run gen:prompts` after editing the template (or the /review skill
 * it mirrors — see integrations/README.md); CI's verify:prompts-fresh fails if
 * the generated files drift from the template.

When the server is registered with \`--standalone=blocking\`, the tool holds

**"Reviewer requested changes"**, read the note as review feedback, make the
requested edits, then call \`submit_review\` again with the same \`source\` and
\`cwd\`. Acknowledge what you changed between submissions. Re-submit at most
**3 times**; if the reviewer still requests changes, stop and ask the human
directly rather than looping.
