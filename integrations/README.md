# Harness integrations

Ready-to-copy MCP configs and review prompts for running Review Buddy outside
Claude Code. Setup instructions: [`../docs/HARNESSES.md`](../docs/HARNESSES.md).

```
cursor/mcp.json                          → merge into .cursor/mcp.json
cursor/commands/review-buddy.md          → copy into .cursor/commands/
vscode-copilot/mcp.json                  → save as .vscode/mcp.json
vscode-copilot/prompts/review-buddy.prompt.md → copy into .github/prompts/
codex/config.toml                        → merge into ~/.codex/config.toml
codex/prompts/review-buddy.md            → copy into ~/.codex/prompts/
```

> **Generated files — don't edit the three prompts by hand.** They are emitted
> from `prompt-template.md` by `bun run gen:prompts` (varying only frontmatter,
> the Step 0 target line, and Codex's blocking-verdict section); CI's
> `verify:prompts-fresh` fails on drift. The template itself is the standalone
> port of `skills/review/SKILL.md` (the structuring-prompt source of truth) —
> when you change the skill's Steps 1–3 or Critical rules, port the change into
> the template and regenerate.
